Hi there! I'm Miriam Kuchersky, a PhD student in the field of Structural Biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science. []https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/
At the laboratory of Prof. Rina Rosenzweig, we're studying the structure and function of chaperones. These are quality-controling proteins that monitor the correct structure of other cellular proteins.
To this end, we're using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which allows us to detect even the most subbtle changes occuring in the structure of chaperones bearing pathogenic mutations, or to describe it's interactions with cellular proteins.
I love the process of planning the desired protein construct and all the way to it's purification and NMR "visualization".
Outside the lab I mostly spend my time like this
